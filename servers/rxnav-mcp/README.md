# RxNav MCP

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `search`  Find drug candidates.
* `properties`  Properties for an identifier.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public NIH RxNav API, the official US drug terminology source.
