# Shields MCP

Generate shields.io style badge URLs. Runs locally with no key.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `badge`  Build a badge URL.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Badges render from the public shields.io service.
