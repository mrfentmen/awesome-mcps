# fourchan mcp

MCP server for **4chan**, board catalogs, threads, and posts from the raw archive of internet culture.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_boards` | All boards, split into SFW / NSFW |
| `get_catalog` | Live threads for a board, sorted by reply count |
| `get_thread` | Read a thread's posts |

## Usage

```bash
npm run build && node dist/index.js
```

Example:

```
get_catalog { board: "g", limit: 10 }
get_thread { board: "g", threadNo: 109460960 }
```

Keyless (the official read only JSON API at a.4cdn.org). Post HTML is flattened to readable text; image filenames are included.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `list_boards`: List all 4chan boards with titles and SFW flags.
- `get_catalog`: Get the catalog (all live threads) for a board.
- `get_thread`: Read a thread

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required unless the project explicitly says otherwise.

## Try it

After building, connect the server through your MCP client. The repository root also contains `smoke-test.mjs` for projects covered by the shared harness. A typical tool call starts with `list_boards`.
