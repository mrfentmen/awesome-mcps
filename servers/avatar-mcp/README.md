# Avatar MCP

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `initials_avatar`  Avatar SVG for a name.
* `avatar_url`  Avatar URL without fetching.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Avatars come from the public DiceBear service.
