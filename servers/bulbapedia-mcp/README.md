# Bulbapedia MCP

Keyless MCP server for Bulbapedia, the Pokémon encyclopedia: species, moves, abilities, episodes, TCG sets.

Pairs well with `smogon-mcp` (competitive data), `pokeapi-mcp` (raw game data), and `pokemon-tcg-mcp` (cards).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `search_articles`: Search species, moves, abilities, characters, episodes, TCG.
- `get_article`: Article summary plus wiki link.
- `random_article`: Discover a random article.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
