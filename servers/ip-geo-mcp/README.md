# IP Geo MCP

Geolocate IP addresses with country, region, city, and ISP data. No key required for limited use.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `lookup`  Geolocate an IP.
* `my_ip`  Current machine public IP.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public ip api. The free tier is limited to 45 requests per minute from one IP.
