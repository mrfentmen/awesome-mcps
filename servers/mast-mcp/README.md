# MAST MCP

Keyless MCP server for MAST: Hubble, Webb, TESS observations by sky position.

Pairs well with `simbad-mcp`, `celestrak-mcp`, and `exoplanets-mcp`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `cone_search`: Observations near RA/Dec with targets, instruments, filters.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
