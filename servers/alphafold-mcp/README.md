# AlphaFold MCP

Keyless MCP server for AlphaFold: protein structure predictions by UniProt accession, confidence scores, model file links.

Pairs well with `uniprot-mcp` (find the accession), `rcsb-pdb-mcp`, and `reactome-mcp`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `get_prediction`: Confidence scores, pipeline, dates for an accession.
- `model_files`: Direct mmCIF/PDB/PAE links plus entry page.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
