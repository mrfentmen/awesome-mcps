# Openverse MCP

Search openly licensed images from the public Openverse catalog. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `search_images`  Search images.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Results come from the public Openverse API. Licenses are reported so you can use images legally.
