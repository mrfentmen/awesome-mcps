This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `image_info`  Details for an image.
* `search_images`  Search images.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public Docker Hub API.
