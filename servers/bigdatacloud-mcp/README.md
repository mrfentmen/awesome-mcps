This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `client_ip`  Get caller IP details.
* `reverse_geocode`  Reverse geocode coordinates to a location.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public Bigdatacloud API.
