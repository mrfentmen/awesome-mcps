```bash
npm run build && node dist/index.js
```

Example:

```
search_pages { query: "Sonic the Hedgehog" }
get_page { title: "Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)" }
list_category { category: "Category:Consoles" }

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

## Try it

After building, connect the server through your MCP client. The repository root also contains `smoke-test.mjs` for projects covered by the shared harness. A typical tool call starts with `search_pages`.
