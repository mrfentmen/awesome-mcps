# Enrico MCP

Enrico (kayaposoft) holiday API: public holidays by country and year. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `countries`  List supported countries.
* `holidays`  Public holidays for a country and year.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public Enrico API.
