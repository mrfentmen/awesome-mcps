METAR and TAF aviation weather reports from the public Aviation Weather Center API. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools

* `taf`  TAF forecasts.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public NOAA Aviation Weather Center API. Aviation weather feeds charge commercially.
