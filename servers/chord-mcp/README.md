# Chord MCP

Build chords and scales from note names locally using music theory. No network, no key.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `chord_notes`  Notes of a chord.
* `scale_notes`  Notes of a scale.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

All music theory runs locally.
