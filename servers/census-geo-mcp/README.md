# Census Geo MCP

Census Bureau geocoding API: address to coordinates and census geography. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `geocode`  Geocode a street address.
* `coordinates`  Reverse geocode coordinates.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public Census Geo API.
