# Bandcamp MCP

Keyless MCP server for Bandcamp discovery: trending and new albums and tracks, genres, artists, stream previews.

Pairs well with `audius-mcp`, `discogs-mcp`, and `musicbrainz-mcp`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `discover`: Trending or new albums/tracks (page links, preview streams). Note: preview stream URLs are signed and expire.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
