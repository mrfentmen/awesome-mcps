# modrinth mcp

Search [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com), the modern Minecraft mod host,
with full loader / game version filtering. No key.

## Tools

- `search_mods`, query + filters: loader (fabric/forge/neoforge/quilt), MC version
- `get_mod`, description, loaders, supported versions, downloads/follows
- `get_mod_versions`, versions with download links + required dependencies

## Run

```bash
npm install && npm run build && node dist/index.js
```

## Example

> "Sodium for Fabric 1.20.1"
> `search_mods("sodium", loader="fabric", gameVersion="1.20.1")`
> → `get_mod_versions("sodium", "fabric", "1.20.1")` → Sodium 0.5.13, 10.2M downloads

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `search_mods`: Search Modrinth for Minecraft mods/modpacks/plugins, optionally
- `get_mod`: Get full details for a Modrinth project by slug: description,
- `get_mod_versions`: List versions of a mod, optionally filtered by loader and game

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required unless the project explicitly says otherwise.

## Try it

After building, connect the server through your MCP client. The repository root also contains `smoke-test.mjs` for projects covered by the shared harness. A typical tool call starts with `search_mods`.
