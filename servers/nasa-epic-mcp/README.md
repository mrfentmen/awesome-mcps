# NASA EPIC MCP

Earth photos from the NASA EPIC camera on the DSCOVR satellite. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `latest`  Latest Earth images.
* `date`  Images for a date.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public NASA EPIC API. Earth imagery from space is rarely free.
