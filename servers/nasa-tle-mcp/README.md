# Nasa Tle MCP

NASA TLE satellite orbital data via tle.ivanstanojevic.me. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `satellite`  Get TLE for a satellite by id.
* `search`  Search satellites by name.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Data comes from the public Nasa Tle API.
