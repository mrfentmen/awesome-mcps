# STAPI MCP

Keyless MCP server for STAPI: Star Trek characters, episodes, series, movies, species.

Pairs well with `star-wars-mcp`, `lotr-mcp`, and `got-mcp`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `search_characters`: Characters by name across all series and movies.
- `get_character`: Gender, birth year and place, height, marital status.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
