# UK Parliament MCP

Keyless MCP server for the UK Parliament Members API: MPs, Lords, parties, constituencies.

Pairs well with `congress-gov-mcp` and `govtrack-mcp`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `search_members`: MPs and Lords by name.
- `get_member`: Party, constituency, house, status.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
