# Reactome MCP

Keyless MCP server for Reactome: search biological pathways, get pathway details, species, hierarchy.

Pairs well with `uniprot-mcp`, `ensembl-mcp`, `string-db-mcp`, and `alphafold-mcp`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio, so it can be connected to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or another compatible MCP client.

## Tools at a glance

- `search_pathways`: Pathways, reactions, molecules by keyword.
- `get_pathway`: Summary, species, compartments, literature, diagram link.

## Limits and privacy

This project is intentionally narrow. It should be treated as a practical helper, not a complete certification or security audit. Check the implementation and the returned data before using it with sensitive material. No credentials are required.
