# Link Shortener MCP

Shorten and expand URLs with the public is.gd service. No key required.

This file is self contained. It reads public data only and never writes to the machine. All output is bounded and honest about what could not be fetched.

## Tools


* `shorten`  Shorten a URL.
* `expand`  Expand a short URL.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

The is.gd service is free and public. Very short URLs are created for real.
